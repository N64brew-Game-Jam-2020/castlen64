# Castle64

No sure what it is yet

Please, don't use project64 2.3.2 with the rom, it seems not to be working. Nightly builds seem fine, so do mupen64, cen64 or hardware

### Commands

D-Pad or stick to move
A button = use the sword / press button or pull lever
B Button = use the shield to protect / use a key

Z Trigger = Activate debug print => worsen frame drops
